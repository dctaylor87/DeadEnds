DeadEnds is intended to be a system for viewing and recording
genealogical information.  It is under development.

This repository is a fork (obviously) of the TomWetmore/DeadEnds
repository.  The main branch is identical to that in the TomWetmore
repository.  The activity in this repository is on the branches.

Currently there is one branch -- dct-experiment -- which is badly in
need of a rename.

On the branch in addition to the directories that are part of Tom's
DeadEnds, you will find the following directories:

Lifelines

    Contains a port of the Lifelines programs llines and llexec.

Reports

    Most of the LL reports.  Written in the LL script language.  These
    differ from the files in Scripts in that they were NOT written to
    test DeadEnds.  They were written as reports for LifeLines.  Some
    were modified for DeadEnds.  Most were taken verbatim from
    LifeLines.  In the future some will be new to DeadEnds.

DeadEndsLib/LLSupport

    Support code for the LL programs.  It isn't always clear whether a file
    belongs here or in Lifelines.  Further, some existing files should likely
    be split in two with pieces in each.  It and Lifelines both need clean up.

DeadEndsLib/Python

    Python embedding for DeadEnds.  If Python and its development files
    are installed on the build system, then Python can be configured as
    a second extension language.

DeadEndsLib/UI

    User interface stuff.  Incomplete.  Work in progress.  A partial
    attempt to factor our user interface stuff from the Lifelines and
    LLSupport directories to more easily support multiple user
    interfaces.
