.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
de\-llexec is a slimmed down version of the \fIde\-llines\fR 
DE lifeLines genealogy program, used for executing reports
from scripts.
.PP
de\-llexec has simplified and stubbed out input/output in
place of de\-llines curses interface, and expects to be invoked
with a report on the commandline (via the \fI-x\fR option).

de\-llexec uses almost all the same options as \fIde\-llines\fR.

.SH FILES
de\-llexec looks for a configuration file for various settings, in
exactly the same manner as \fIde\-llines\fR. See the DE LifeLines userguide
for details.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
The DE LifeLines documentation should be installed as part of the installation,
and may also be viewed at the project site: https://lifelines.github.io/lifelines/
Look for ll-userguide and ll-reportmanual (with appropriate extensions for
text, html and pdf formats).
The normal installation process includes a large number of sample report
programs that you can customize to suit your needs.  In the directory.
containing these reports you should find a file named index.html which gives a
very brief summary of each report.
