.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
The DE LifeLines programs looks for configuration files in a variety of
locations.  If a configuratiion file is specified on the command line,
it is read.  Otherwise, if the environment variables
.B LLCONFIGFILE
exists, the file pointed to is read.  Otherwise, the following three
configuration files are searched for and read, in turn, if found:
.br
.I /etc/de-lifelines.conf
.br
.I ~/.linesrc
(on Windows,
.I ~/lines.cfg
is read instead).
.br
.I ./.linesrc
(on Windows,
.I ./lines.cfg
is read instead)

Finally, if the database defines the option
.B LLCONFIGFILE
then that file is read.

.SH FILES
.I /etc/de-lifelines.conf
.br
.I ~/.linesrc

.I ~/lines.cfg

.SH DOCUMENTATION
The DE LifeLines documentation should be installed as part of the installation,
and may also be viewed at the project site: https://lifelines.github.io/lifelines/
Look for ll-userguide and ll-reportmanual (with appropriate extensions for
text, html and pdf formats).
The normal installation process includes a large number of sample report
programs that you can customize to suit your needs.  In the directory
containing these reports you should find a file named index.html which gives a
very brief summary of each report.
