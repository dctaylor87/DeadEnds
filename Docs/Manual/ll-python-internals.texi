@chapter DeadEnds Internals

@section Overview
This document concerns itself with the needs of those that wish to
modify DeadEnds -- whether to extend the Python embedding or fix a
bug in it -- or to modify the core of DeadEnds.

The focus is on understanding the Python embedding and the DeadEnds
code that it is embedded in well enough to modify the embedding,
whether to extend it or to fix bugs in it.

If your goal is to USE the Python embedding, then please consult the
document ``DeadEnds Python Extension''.  If your goal is to use the
DeadEnds Report Writing language, then please consult the document
``DeadEnds Programming Subsystem and Report Generator''.

Much of the Python internals knowledge needed is covered by the
documents ``Extending and Embedding Python'' and ``The Python/C API''
which are part of the standard Python distribution.  They were
consulted heavily during the implementation of the DeadEnds Python
extension.

The other large knowledge base needed is knowledge of DeadEnds
internals.  When I started the Python embedding project, there was a
dearth of information available on LifeLines internals and DeadEnds
had not yet been released.  There is more internals information
available for DeadEnds than for LifeLines.  This document is an
attempt to partially fill in some of the holes.

While some of the information presented is specific to the Python
embedding, most should be useful to anyone wishing to modify DeadEnds.
That said, the functions, variables, and macros documented are those
that I encountered during the implementation of the Python embedding
for LifeLines and subsequent port to DeadEnds.  If I didn't encounter
it, it is likely not documented here.

There are many many gaps here.  If a knowledge or understanding of
something was not needed as part of the Python embedding project, you
will probably not find it here unless it was added at a later date.
For example, there was no need to study the lexing and parsing of the
DeadEnds report writing language, so you won't find anything about
that here.  Nor, was there much need to study the disk layout of the
LifeLines database -- beyond high level functions for activities such
as importing, exporting, and related activities.  And DeadEnds keeps
everything in memory, so any such description would be largely wrong
for DeadEnds.

This document is meant to supplement, not replace, the DeadEnds
GitHub Markdown files.

While this document was written primarily for those wishing to modify
the Python specific portions of DeadEnds, the bulk of this document
concerns the code of DeadEnds and should be of value to those
modifying the core of DeadEnds.

Due to its origin, there are portions of this document that still use
LifeLines terminology or that have a LifeLines perspective.  If you
notice them, please feel free to point them out.

It is my hope that this document will grow and improve over time.
Feedback, additions, and corrections are both welcomed and encouraged.

Feedback can be given directly to me, via GitHub, or (if they do not
object), the the LINES-L mailing list.
@section Layout

There are a number of subsystems each in its own subdirectory.  Here
is a description of the subdirectories.

@subsection Libraries

@itemize @bullet
@item @file{DeadEndsLib/DataTypes}

Implementations of the various datatypes that are part of the DeadEnds
system.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Database}

The code for the database itself.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Gedcom}

Most of the code for doing GEDCOM related things to the database lives
here.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Interp}

The code that implements the user callable functions of the DeadEnds
Report writing language.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/LLSupport}

Code to support the use of the LifeLines curses interface with
DeadEnds.  Much of this code was taken from various LifeLines
directories, such as @file{src/gedlib} and @file{src/stdlib} and then
modified for DeadEnds.  Some is original to DeadEnds.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Parser}

The code that implements the lexing and the parsing of the DeadEnds
Report writing language.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Python}

Support for the Python embedding.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/UI}

User interface, obviously.  Less obviously, the code here is used by
@command{llexec} and not by @command{llines}.  Some of the routines
here are mere stubs of their more fleshed out cousins that live in
@code{liflines}.  Stubs that should be, in my opinion, fleshed out.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Utils}

Not a subsystem, as such, but rather a collection of routines that are
meant to be generically useful across subsystems.  Some of the
routines are implementations of functionality that is available on
many systems, but not everywhere.

@item @file{DeadEndsLib/Validate}

Code for validating a GEDCOM file that is being imported.

@end itemize

@subsection Programs

@itemize @bullet
@item @file{Lifelines}

The code that deals with the screen (via @code{ncurses}), the various
menus, the user interaction, and various routines that do not have a
better location to live.  Most of this code was taken from the
@file{src/liflines} directory of LifeLines and then modified to build
and work with DeadEnds.  Some is original to DeadEnds.

@item @file{Programs}

Various programs that link with the DeadEnds code.  You can find a
DeadEnds version of @command{llexec} in this directory.

@item @file{TestProgram}

Programs for testing DeadEnds.

@end itemize

@subsection Miscellaneous
@itemize @bullet
@item @file{Docs}

Various documentation files about DeadEnds.  Look in a subdirectory
matching a top level directory for markdown information about what is
implemented in that top level directory.

In Manual you will find some Texinfo documentation such as this document.

@item @file{Gedfiles}

GEDCOM files that are used (by the programs in TestProgram) in testing
the DeadEnds code.

@item @file{Reports}
@item @file{TeX}

@item @file{build}

Files used by the build system tools to aid in the use of
@command{autoconf}, @command{automake}, and @command{autoheader}.

@end itemize

@section Python Files

For the Python embedding, the emphasis is on records, not nodes.  The
header files live in @file{DeadEndsLib/Python/Includes}.

@itemize @bullet

@item @file{Makefile.am}

Simple makefile saying which files belong to the Python extension and
the name of the library that contains the compiled files.

@item @file{Makefile.in}

Boring.  Generated by automake.  @b{DO NOT EDIT.}  If you edit, your
changes @b{WILL BE LOST} the next time that @command{automake} is run.

@item @file{database.c}, @file{database.h}

Contains database centric routines such as @code{firstindi}, @code{lastindi},
@code{firstfam}, and @code{lastfam}.
@findex firstindi
@findex lastindi
@findex firstfam
@findex lastfam

@item @file{event.c}

Event (GNode, not RECORD) and date specific routines are found here.

@item @file{family.c}, @file{family.h}

Most everythiing that deals with FAM RECORDs.

@item @file{iter.c}, @file{iter.h}

Iterators for individual, family, source, event, and other RECORDs are
found here.

@item @file{nodes.c}

@item @file{other.c}

Allocation, deallocation, and iteration of OTHR RECORDs.

@item @file{person.c}, @file{person.h}

Most everything that deals with INDI RECORDs.  Might ought to be
renamed to individual.[ch].

@item @file{python-to-c.c}, @file{python-to-c.h}

Contains PyInit_llines, llpy_init, and a handful of functions and
variables that don't really fit anywhere else.

@item @file{records.c}

Functions which are RECORD type agnostic, for example the functions
@code{key_to_record} and @code{keynum_to_record} are found here.

@item @file{run.c}

Functions for running the Python interpreter -- whetther interactively
or on a file are found here.

@item @file{set.c}, @file{set.h}

Non-instance functions that take or return sets.

@item @file{source.c}

Allocation, deallocation, and iteration of SOUR RECORDs.

@item @file{types.c}, @file{types.h}

Rich compare functions for records and nodes.  Hash function for records.

@item @file{user.c}

Those user interaction functions which are not instance methods can be
found in here.

@end itemize

@section GNodes and RECORDs

The DeadEnds Report Writing language primarily deals with GNodeS.  By
contrast, the Python Extension primarily deals with RECORDS.

Both GNodes and RECORDs are refernce counted.  When creating a
reference to either a GNode or a RECORD it is important to ensure that
its reference count is incremented.  And when destroying a reference,
that it is decremented.

NOTE: The GNode reference counts @b{DO NOT} include references from
other GNodes, such as the parent, sibling, and child links.  Nor the
link from a RECORD to its top GNode.  The reference counts @b{DO} count
the number of @code{PVALUE}s and @code{PyObject}s that point to the
GNode.

Additionally, GNodes have a flags element.  Currently, only one flag
bit is defined -- whether the GNode is a temporary GNode or not.  A
tempoary GNode is a GNode that is not part of the GNode tree of any
RECORD.

@subsection Temporary GNodes

Temporary nodes are created by @code{createTempGNode}.  They are
freed by @code{freeTempGNodeTree}.  The @{ temp | non-temp @} status
can be tested by calling @code{isTempGNode}.  And the @{ temp |
non-temp @} status can be @{ set | cleared @} by calling
@code{setTempGNode}.

Temporary nodes, when created, are marked with flag @code{ND_TEMP}.

When one node is made the { parent | child } of another node, the {
temp | non-temp } status of the parent is @b{NOT} propagated to the
new child(ren).  It should be.  This is a @b{BUG}.

When the reference count of a node is { incremented | decremented },
that change is not propagated down the tree.  It should be.  This is a
@b{BUG}.

When the reference count for a temporary node reaches zero, it, its
children, and their siblings are all freed -- without checking their
reference counts.  Oopps.  Another @b{BUG}.

@section Application Programmer Interfaces

The lists of functions, macros, and variables in the following
chapters are @b{very} incomplete.  They are largely the result of
investigations made to facilitate adding Python as a scripting
language.  Additions and corrections are both encouraged and welcomed.

@end deftypefun

@subsection GNode Reference Counts

At one level, reference counts are only meaningful for temporary
nodes.  A 'permanent' node is not freed unless the containing record
is freed.

However...

A permanent node can be detached, at which time it is then a temporary
node (ditto for its children and their siblings), not a permanent
node, and therefore subject to being freed if it has a zero reference
count.

Since a permanent node may at any time be detached and therefore
become a temporary node, the reference count needs to kept correct at
all times for all nodes.

The reference count does @b{NOT} reflect references from within the
node tree itself.  Nor does it reflect references from records.  It
@b{DOES} reflect references from the DeadEnds Report Writing language
(@code{PVALUE}'s) and reference from within Python (from within
@code{PyObject}'s).

@defmac nrefcnt (node) @arrow{} INT
Given a GNode* @code{node}, returns the reference count of the GNode.

There is not, as of this writing, a function for incrementing nor a
function for decrementing the reference count of a GNode (though
perhaps there should be).

To increment the reference count of a GNode @code{node}, use either
@code{nrefcnt(node)++} or @code{++nrefcnt(node)}.  And to decrement
the reference count use either @code{nrefcnt(node)--} or
@code{--nrefcnt(node)}.
@end defmac

@section Variables and Constants
@subsection Messages and Other Strings

To facilitate translation, many -- but not all -- of the strings
printed by LifeLines were collected into one file --
@file{gedlib/messages.c}.  That file appears in DeadEnds as @file{LLSupport/messages.c}.
Some of these strings represent warning and
error messages, some are menu choices, and others are words and
phrases, such as ``born'', ``died'', and ``married'' that are used in
various contexts.

There are over 600 ``messages''.  They are defined in
@file{messages.c} and declared in @file{messages.h}.  Both are found
in the @file{DeadEndsLib/LLSupport} tree.

All of the ``messages'', such as:

@defvr Message qSaskstr
@end defvr
@defvr Message qSchoostrttl
@end defvr
@defvr Message qSifonei
@end defvr
@defvr Message qSnotonei
@end defvr

have variable names that start with @code{qS}.

@subsection Miscellaneous Variables

@section User Interface Wrappers
The functions in this section are used by the reporting writing
functions to wrap the user interaction so as to be able to give a more
accurate timing of how long a script takes to run.  There is still
some ``computation'' within the wrapper, but it is reduced.

@defun rptui_ask_for_fam (String s1, String s2) @arrow{} RECORD
Wrapper around @code{ask_for_fam}.
@end defun

@defun rptui_ask_for_indi (String ttl, ASK1Q ask1) @arrow{} RECORD
Wrapper around @code{ask_for_indi}.
@end defun

@defun rptui_ask_for_int (String ttl, INT *prtn) @arrow{} bool

@section Types

Types can be approached from two perspectives -- the C perspective and
the Python perspective.

For a C perspective, there are five types defined by the Python
extension:

@itemize @bullet
@item LLINES_PY_NODE
@tindex LLINES_PY_NODE

This contains two DeadEnds specific fields -- @code{lln_node}, a
pointer to a GNode and, when known, @code{lln_type} records the type of
the RECORD that contains the GNode.  When the record type is unknown,
which is often, the @code{lln_type} field is initialized to zero.
The @code{lln_type} field might be eliminated in the future.

@item LLINES_PY_RECORD
@tindex LLINES_PY_RECORD

Like LLINES_PY_NODE, this contains two DeadEnds specific fields --
@code{llr_record} and @code{llr_type}.  The field @code{llr_record}
points to a RECORD.  And the field @code{llr_type} contains the type
of the RECORD.  The type is @b{always} known.

@item LLINES_PY_ITER
@tindex LLINES_PY_ITER

This contains two DeadEnds specific fields -- @code{li_type} and
@code{li_current}.  The @code{li_type} records the type of RECORD
being iterated over.  And the @code{li_current} records the keynum of
the most recently returned RECORD.  If no iteration has occurred, the
value is 0.  If it has been exhaused, the value is -1.

@item LLINES_PY_NODEITER
@tindex LLINES_PY_NODEITER

This is used for iterating over GNodeS.  And there is more than one
type of GNode iteration.  As a result, this type is more complex and
has five DeadEnds specific fields:

@itemize
@item @code{ni_top_node}

This is the top of the GNode tree being iterated over.

@item @code{ni_cur_node}

This is the most recently returned GNode.  If iteration has not
started, this is NULL.

@item @code{ni_tag}

When iterating, if we are looking for a specific tag, this is that
tag.  Otherwise this is NULL.  When it is non-NULL, only nodes having
a matching tag will be returned.
@item @code{ni_type}

This is the type of GNode iteration to perform: There is child
iteration, where we iterate over the immediate children of the top
node.  And there is whole tree iteration, where we iterate over all
the nodes in the tree.  When doing whole tree iteration, we do depth
first, parent before child.

@item @code{ni_level}

This records how far we are from the top node of the tree being
iterated over.  For whole tree iteration it is part of the return
value.  Before we start it will be 0.  After exhaustion it will be -1.
@end itemize

@item LLINES_PY_DATABASE
@tindex LLINES_PY_DATABASE

This is used for database types.  Currently there is only one database
instance -- the current database.  This exists for the future when
there are multiple databases.

@end itemize

From a Python perspective, the types are:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{llines.Database}
@tindex llines.Database
@item @code{llines.Event}
@tindex llines.Event
@item @code{llines.Family}
@tindex llines.Family
@item @code{llines.Individual}
@tindex llines.Individuals
@item @code{llines.Iter}
@tindex llines.Iter
@item @code{llines.NodeIter}
@tindex llines.NodeIter
@item @code{llines.Node}
@tindex llines.Node
@item @code{llines.Other}
@tindex llines.Other
@item @code{llines.Source}
@tindex llines.Source
@end itemize
