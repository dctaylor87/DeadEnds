There are many MANY functions that are not documented here.  Currently
only slightly over one third of the core DeadEnds functions are
listed.

Currently, only functions found in core DeadEnds libraries are listed.
The @code{LLSupport}, @code{Python}, and @code{UI} libraries are
@b{NOT} core DeadEnds libraries.  Descriptions of their functions and
variables might be added in the future.

While the intent is to document @b{ALL} the functions meant to be
called by applications, which functions are in that category isn't
always clear.

In addition to functions meant to be called by applications, there are
functions meant only to be called from within the same library and
functions meant only to be called from within other DeadEnds
libraries.

So, for a first cut, this document concentrates on the functions in
the core DeadEnds libraries that are called by the port of the
LifeLines user interface.

It is hoped that it will eventually encompass all of the DeadEnds
functions meant to be called by applications.

Additionally, its focus is on the @b{interfaces}, not on the
@b{internals}.  Documentation of the internals is important for
someone wishing to support, maintain, enhance, or extend the
libraries, but is not the focus of this document.  The focus of this
document is on @b{using} the libraries.  Hence the emphasis on the
interfaces.
