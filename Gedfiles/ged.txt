2 HEAD Opinion of The Day \ Richard Hancock
2 TEXT To many people in Eastern Connecticut, the name of Richard J.
3 CONT Hancock is synonymous with Lawrence Memorial Hospital.  There is
3 CONT good reason for that impression.  Dick Hancock had devoted the
3 CONT greater part of his life, some 42 years, to achieve the smooth
3 CONT functioning service qualities of the hospital.  It is today a
3 CONT regional institution, widely respected throughout the Northeast,
3 CONT largely because Mr. Hancock gave so much of himself to insure
3 CONT its success.
3 CONT
3 CONT Lawrence Memorial was a smalltown community hospital when he
3 CONT went to work there in the bookkeeping department in 1927.  But
3 CONT his interests were not confined to the ledgers.  His overriding,
3 CONT but never effusive, concern was for the people who were patients
3 CONT and for their relatives, for the doctors, nurses and support
3 CONT staff and for the environment in which all came together there
3 CONT in the cause of humanity.
3 CONT
3 CONT Mr. Hancock's dedication did not escape the perceptive eye of
3 CONT Katherine Prindiville, the then superintendent.  Miss
3 CONT Prindiville gave him the opportunity to act as understudy, and
3 CONT assignment he accepted with untiring zeal.  It was only natural
3 CONT that when she retired in March, 1937, he was named her
3 CONT successor.
3 CONT
3 CONT No better choice could have been made.
3 CONT
3 CONT The great advances in medicine were changing all hospitals for
3 CONT the better, making them of greater service to many more people.
3 CONT It is to Mr. Hancock's credit and the community's advantage that
3 CONT he understood the needs and was able to become a leader in
3 CONT seeing that needs were met.  Four major wings were added during
3 CONT his tenure.  Despite the difficulties such construction entail
3 CONT for a fully operational hospital, it was a remarkably smooth
3 CONT transition from small community hospital to a 324-bed regional
3 CONT general institution.
3 CONT
3 CONT Essentially, Richard J. Hancock was a conservative person.  It
3 CONT was among other qualities that enabled him to succeed in casting
3 CONT into permanent mold the dreams and aspirations of the many who
3 CONT rallied to the call for an improved hospital.
3 CONT
3 CONT Something at Lawrence Memorial should bear his name in
3 CONT perpetuity.  We can think of no more fitting tribute than to
3 CONT name the new North Wing for him.
3 CONT
3 CONT For this was a man who deserves to be remembered, to be emulated
3 CONT by all in daily living.  Humane, yet tough-minded.  An honest,
3 CONT hard-working, keen-minded professional who achieved much which
3 CONT will benefit humankind in these parts for many years to come.
3 CONT Richard J. Hancock sought no personal honors during a lifetime
3 CONT of work in behalf of this community.;  But now it is right that
3 CONT we express ourselves in meaningful terms.  Richard J. Hancock
3 CONT achieved a lot that was good for this city and for its environs.

3 CONT Brunswick, etc., etc., etc.
3 CONT
3 CONT The Petition of John Wetmore of Hampton in Kings County
3 CONT
3 CONT Humbly Sheweth
3 CONT
3 CONT That he has a wife and ten children viz: six sons and
3 CONT four daughters, seven of them natives of this Province for
3 CONT whose present support he feels himself bound to provide - after
3 CONT an appointment of several years he has found it impossible with
3 CONT diligence and the strictest economy on the lot originally drawn
3 CONT by Your Petitioner to furnish a competent present maintenance
3 CONT nor is the lot capable of being ever so divided as to make more
3 CONT settlements than one.
3 CONT Your Petitioner has therefore found it necessary to abandon his
3 CONT first purpose of performing the cultivation of that lot as a
3 CONT provision for his family and has reluctantly parted with it to
3 CONT another to the size of whose family it is better proportioned.
3 CONT Your Petitioner has explored the nonsettled lands several miles
3 CONT distant from any settlement and has found a tract consisting of
3 CONT hard wood and soft wood land and strips of intervale so
3 CONT situated as by taking in seven or eight hundred acres much of
3 CONT which is of little or no value a settlement may at some future
3 CONT time by hard labor be made for himself and some of his sons.
3 CONT He therefore begs Your Excellency will be pleased to grant him
3 CONT the tract of land last mentioned which is situated and
3 CONT described as follows viz: beginning at the south west corner
3 CONT of a tract of land petitioned for some time since by Isaiah
3 CONT Smith thence south partly on that tract and partly on

3 CONT rear line of lands formerly granted to Humphrey Butt and
3 CONT others on Hammond River thence continuing westerly on said
3 CONT rear line to a station where a line north seventy east will

2 TEXT I have seen the land petitioned for - the tract contains
3 CONT several strips of good land and a great deal of soft wood
3 CONT land of little value, but is capable of making a good
3 CONT settlement and will probably accommodate more than one of
3 CONT the family - Mr. Wetmore's ten children, if placed on
3 CONT inviting land, will doubtless become permanent settlers
3 CONT in the County, particularly as the father and his numerous
3 CONT relatives settled here, are strongly attached to the Province
3 CONT and the British Government.
3 CONT I therefore hope he will be accommodated with the land he
3 CONT asks for and he will immediately commence the settlement of
3 CONT it, in which he will be encouraged by the _____ _____

1 NOTE Daniel Van Cott Wetmore married Hannah Trask in 1818 (from three
2 CONT sources, although none refer to an original record).
2 CONT Hannah may have been from Beaver River.
2 CONT Her father was Thomas Trask, possibly the Thomas Trask living
2 CONT in Beaver River in 1820 when a fire destroyed much property,
2 CONT including his grist mill.
2 CONT From the information available, I believe that Daniel
2 CONT and Hannah spent their first few years of marriage in Nova Scotia,
2 CONT but soon removed to New Brunswick.
2 CONT Daniel is not listed in the 1827 census of Nova Scotia, which
2 CONT includes both Yarmouth and Digby Counties.
1 NOTE Daniel and Hannah's first child may have been son Jesse Wetmore, likely
2 CONT born in 1819; he is said to have run away from home to Florida where
2 CONT he died of yellow fever; I have found no trace of him (my only
2 CONT information about Jesse and Charity [see below] come from brief
2 CONT notes quoting Thomas Trask Wetmore Sr, a grandson of Daniel Van Cott
2 CONT Wetmore).
2 CONT It is possible that the Joseph C. Wetmore, found on a few
2 CONT records in Norwich, Connecticut, may be this Jesse.
1 NOTE
2 CONT Daniel and Hannah's next child was Daniel Lorenzo Wetmore,
2 CONT born in April 1821, possibly in Yarmouth, although his exact birth
2 CONT place has not been found.
2 CONT Daniel Lorenzo Wetmore was named for Lorenzo Dow, an eccentric
2 CONT Methodist minister from Montville, Connecticut, whose wide ranging
2 CONT travels included the maritimes; Daniel Van Cott is said to
2 CONT have enjoyed reading Dow's sermons; Norwich, Connecticut, where
2 CONT Daniel Van Cott lived for many years, borders Montville.
1 NOTE
2 CONT Daniel Van Cott Wetmore and Hannah Trask had at least two daughters.
2 CONT One, Mary Ann Wetmore, married Edwin Penn Williams, of
2 CONT New Brunswick, where they lived until his death.
2 CONT They were married in 1840 in Trinity Church; on the marriage record
2 CONT Mary Ann is of Portsmouth, a neighborhood in St John; this indicates
2 CONT that Daniel Van Cott Wetmore may have been living with his family
2 CONT in St John at this time.
2 CONT A second daughter, Charity Wetmore, is said to have removed to
2 CONT Pennsylvania; I have found no trace of her.
1 NOTE
2 CONT Daniel and Hannah had at least one more son, Thomas Trask Wetmore,
2 CONT youngest of the three known sons; on his naturalization papers
2 CONT Thomas states he was born in Saint John, New Brunswick; various records
2 CONT place his birth between 1826 and 1829, with 1827 most likely.
1 NOTE
2 CONT Daniel Van Cott Wetmore married his second wife, Cynthia
2 CONT Perkins, in 1829; at that time they may have both been
2 CONT residing in Norton, Kings County, New Brunswick.
2 SENT Daniel and Cynthia had a number of children.
2 SENT Some of them were probably born at North Range, Digby County,
2 CONT where, according to land records, Daniel was a carpenter from at
2 CONT least 1848 until 1852, possibly until 1862, when he appears in
2 CONT Norwich, Connecticut, records.
1 NOTE
2 CONT Daniel lived in Norwich, Connecticut, from at least 1862 until
2 CONT the late 1870s.
2 CONT During this period Daniel and a number of his sons were
2 CONT involved in the shipbuilding trade in Norwich.
1 NOTE Daniel Van Cott Wetmore died on 13 September 1881, in Brooklyn, Kings
2 CONT County, New York, of cancer, and he was buried in Norwich,
2 CONT Connecticut, on 15 September 1881.
2 CONT His death is recorded in both the Brooklyn and Norwich vital records;
2 CONT he outlived both his wives.
2 CONT The Brooklyn death certificate states he was living in Brooklyn for
2 CONT four years before his death.
1 NOTE This is from a hand written note made by Lucille Borges Kimble when interviewing
2 CONT Thomas Trask Wetmore Sr.
2 CONT Daniel Lorenzo W. (Frank B.'s grandfather) was born 1821 - named after Lorenzo Dow
2 CONT of Oxoboxo. (Daniel's father used to read Dow's sermons).
2 CONT Daniel L. W. lived to be 83. He had an older brother Jesse, who ran away from home
2 CONT to Florida & died there, young, of yellow fever.
2 CONT Daniel had sisters - one Mary Ann Williams, whose husband was related to William Penn.
2 CONT Charity, another sister, lived in Pennsylvania.
2 CONT Daniel's wife's maiden name - Doty - her mother's, Savory.
2 CONT Daniel's dau. Emmeline Terentia (mother of Frank B.) was married in Boston
2 CONT to Michel Borges of the Azores, whose father had a large distillery in Azores -
2 CONT (by which he made the money to send Michel to Oxford to college).
2 CONT Michel was consul to Boston - also had an import business - citrus fruits from
2 CONT Azores. He killed himself when a large cargo was lot at sea - ruining his own and
2 CONT friends' investment - his son Frank a babe was brought up by Wetmore
2 CONT grandparents (Daniel, above) - and his mother remarried - a Barnes, and had
2 CONT a large family subsequently.

3 CONT Mr. T. T. Wetmore Writes Entertainingly of Shipbuilding Between 1855 and 1866.
3 CONT
3 CONT I saw in the BULLETIN of March 5, writes T. T. Wetmore from Titusville, Florida,
3 CONT a history of shipbuilding in Norwich from away back in the "ye olden times." As I had
3 CONT something to do in that line in Norwich from 1855 to 1866, I think I can give you a
3 CONT little more definite account of the vessels built in that time than anyone else.
3 CONT
3 CONT I went to Norwich on January 1, 1855, and took the job to plank and ceil the schooner
3 CONT Col. Lester of about 250 tons, built for J. M. Huntington & Co. and Col. Lester of
3 CONT Preston, by Harrison P. Lamphier. She was launched from a yard just below the old railroad
3 CONT bridge over the Shetucket, on July 4, 1855. That winter Mr. Lamphier contracted with
3 CONT J. M. Huntington & Co. to build the barge Thames, which I build under sub contract, and
3 CONT launched her June 12, the same year. She was 140 tons. As Lamphier had this yard leased,
3 CONT and there being no other available place, I started a new yard near the Norwich and
3 CONT Worcester railroad station, just where the iron bridge abutment is now, and build the
3 CONT schooner Sally Gay, 200 tons, and launched her April 7, 1856. Then I build the schooner
3 CONT I. K. Marvel of 200 tons, which was launched November 11, 1856. These were all for J. M.
3 CONT Huntington & Co.
3 CONT
3 CONT The I. K. Marvel, commanded by Capt. Eldridge of Cape Cod, was the pioneer schooner to
3 CONT open the West India trade which in later years grew to such large proportions.
3 CONT
3 CONT In the summer of 1860 the afore-named firm built a new shipyard at Thamesville by filling
3 CONT from the high bank where Shipping street now is, the pond of water inside the railroad
3 CONT track and the flats outside the track to the bulkhead near the channel, where we put in a
3 CONT marine railway, and I commenced to build the propeller Norwich, which was intended for
3 CONT a passenger and freight boat to run from Ponce to Saint John on the Isle of Porto Rico.
3 CONT She was of 432 tons burthen and about the size of the gunboats which were ordered by
3 CONT congress and the breaking out of the war. Samuel Rook[?], naval constructor, heard of this
3 CONT boat, and when she was well along in construction, bought her for one of the sixteen
3 CONT gunboats ordered by the government. She was coppered, gun deck put it, with magazine, and
3 CONT equipped all ready for her guns and delivered in New York to the government Sept. 28, 1861.
3 CONT
3 CONT I then build the propeller Trade Wind, of the same size, and launched her April 5, 1862.
3 CONT This boat followed Admiral Farragut into New Orleans. The captain bought a cargo of sugar
3 CONT and she paid for herself the first voyage she made.
3 CONT
3 CONT The owners, J. M. Huntington & Co., presented every man who worked on her with a 25-pound
3 CONT box of sugar; myself with a barrel of 228 pounds; E. Proctor 100 pounds; S. N. Gladwin,
3 CONT foreman joiner, 100 pounds. As only three and a half pounds of suger could then be bought
3 CONT for $1, the gift was appreciated pretty highly.
3 CONT
3 CONT The third vessel built was the propeller Prometheus, 650 tons, launched in 1863; fourth,
3 CONT propeller Perrit, 713 tons, launched in fall of 1863; fifth, the propeller Whirlwind,
3 CONT 430 tons, launched early in 1864; sixth, propeller Uncas, 325 tons, built in 1864;
3 CONT seventh, propeller Chace, 515 tons, launched in 1865; eighth, propeller Hunter, built in
3 CONT 1865, 515 tons; ninth, propeller Utility, 650 tons, launched 1866.
3 CONT
3 CONT These were all double decked vessels but the Uncas which was a single deck vessel.
3 CONT As there could be no yellow pine got from the south in those days on account of the war,
3 CONT we had to depend on our own country for all the timber, plank, etc., and the towns of
3 CONT Montville, Bozrah, Preston, Scotland and Lebanon were well scoured for timber. Many an
3 CONT old farmer who got big prices for timber had occasion to bless the name of J. M.
3 CONT Huntington & Co.
3 CONT
3 CONT Mr. E. Proctor was not foreman of the yard, but was the boss machinist and built the
3 CONT engines for all the boats but the Norwich, which were built by the late Eliot Barber.
3 CONT The boilers were built by William Troland.

2 TEXT Mr Wetmore,
3 CONT My mother and I have been tracing the family tree and have come
3 CONT across a Wetmore line and wonder if there is any connection to
3 CONT your line.
3 CONT We have a Dorothy Wetmore b 4/4/1751 in Middletown, CT in
3 CONT our line.
3 CONT She married John Rockwell, Jr.
3 CONT Dorothy's father was Increase Wetmore born 7/2/1726 in
3 CONT Middletown, CT.
3 CONT When I saw your James Wetmore who was born 12/31/1695 in
3 CONT Middletown I couldn't help wondering if there was a connection.
3 CONT Have you ever run across an Increase Wetmore in your research?
3 CONT If you have, we surely would appreciate any info you could share
3 CONT with us on him.
1 EVEN Email Received
2 DATE 8 September 1996
2 TEXT I have a question about the information you sent on the Wetmores.
3 CONT I gave a copy to my mother.
3 CONT She had done more work on this line than I was aware and she had
3 CONT a different set of parents for Sarah Chilson, wife of Increase
3 CONT Wetmore.
3 CONT She has Sarah's parents as a John Chilson Jr and Sarah Wetmore.
3 CONT She has info on these people back about 4 generations.
3 CONT John Chilson Jr's parents are John Chilson Sr and Sarah Jenks and
3 CONT Sarah Wetmore's parents are Beriah Wetmore and Margaret Stow.
3 CONT This looks like another connection to the Wetmores, if it's
3 CONT accurate.
3 CONT My problem with her info is I'm not sure how well documented it
3 CONT is, if at all.
3 CONT She seems to have started up this line when she received an eight
3 CONT generation chart from a lady in Ohio starting with Dorothy Wetmore.
3 CONT How sure are you that Daniel Chilson is Sarah Chilson's father?
3 CONT Did you get a reference for this information somewhere?
3 CONT If so, I'd appreciate it if you would share it with me, as Mother
3 CONT may be "barking up the wrong tree", literally.
3 CONT I see in my Family Tree Maker that I have the ability to send out
3 CONT info with the GEDCOM format.
3 CONT I will hold off trying that, however, until hearing from you on
3 CONT this question.
3 CONT I obviously don't have Mother's 8 generation chart in my computer
3 CONT that deals with Dorothy Wetmore because I'm not sure it's relevant.
3 CONT If you think it might be, I'll send you a copy snail mail and will
3 CONT also include my info on Dorothy Wetmore at the same time.

2 CONT Boston, October 17, 1873
2 CONT Melancholy Suicide
2 CONT The Portuguese Consul Shoots Himself
2 CONT Through the Head
2 CONT
2 CONT At about half-past four yesterday afternoon M. de F. H. Borges,
2 CONT Portuguese Consul and Vice Consul for Brazil, shot himself
2 CONT through the head with a pistol in an archway on Central wharf.
2 CONT He had left his office No. 27 Central Wharf but a few moments
2 CONT previous, telling his wife, who was in the office at the time,
2 CONT that he was going out, but did not say when he should return.
2 CONT He then kissed her and left the office, going directly to the
2 CONT archway, where, drawing a revolver from his pocket and holding
2 CONT it to his head, he fired, the ball entering the skull just
2 CONT above the right temple, killing him instantly.
2 CONT
2 CONT Officer Hathaway of Station Two, hearing the report hastened to
2 CONT the spot and found the unfortunate gentleman lying in a pool of
2 CONT blood.
2 CONT Sergeant Foster of Station Two arrived soon after and had the
2 CONT remains conveyed to the House of Reception, where they were
2 CONT viewed by Coroner Foye, who concluded that, under the
2 CONT circumstances, an inquest would be unnecessary.
2 CONT A gold watch and chain and a considerable sum of money were
2 CONT found upon the deceased together with a number of papers, the
2 CONT contents of which afforded no information as to the motive
2 CONT which led to the commission of the act of suicide.
2 CONT
2 CONT The pistol which was used was a six shooter of the Smith and
2 CONT Wesson pattern, and as it was stated by those who knew him
2 CONT that he was not in the habit of carrying a pistol, it is
2 CONT supposed that the weapon was obtained with a view to self
2 CONT destruction.
2 CONT
2 CONT The deceased was born in the island of Flores and came to this
2 CONT country about 25 years ago.
2 CONT He was, as will be remembered by those who knew him, a fine
2 CONT looking man and a man of excellent education, speaking several
2 CONT languages with great fluency.
2 CONT On coming to this country he entered a printing establishment
2 CONT in Charleston, where he served his apprenticeship.
2 CONT He also was the author of a book entitled "A Guide to
2 CONT Portuguese Conversation".
2 CONT He has been well known in business circles in this city for a
2 CONT number of years, having been engaged particularly in the trade
2 CONT with the Western Islands, which he aided materially in
2 CONT developing.

2 CONT In Reply to: Daniel Wetmore b 1820 Canada by Dana Callis
2 CONT Dear Dana, I'd love to correspond with you - are you a relative?
2 CONT Daniel was my maternal great-grandfather.
2 CONT I have only just started researching my family so have not gone too far.
2 CONT I do not have his date of birth but have just received my grandmother's birth certificate which states
2 CONT that her mother's name was Elizabeth Roberts.
2 CONT I have found the reference to ER and DW's marriage in the St Catherine's House Index
2 CONT (which we have here in Canberra, Australia) and I have sent to England for that certificate.
2 CONT The marriage took place in the December quarter of 1858.
2 CONT I have found the family in the 1881 census (but searched last night at the LDS History Centre
2 CONT for Daniel but he was not in England in 1881 - intersting!).
2 CONT My grand mother, Phoebe, was the eldest child, followed by Douglas and 2 girls
2 CONT (one of which I vaguely remember as a very old woman in 1945).
2 CONT All the children are listed in the census as having been born in Liverpool!
2 CONT I can give you as many details as I have, perhaps you can help me!! Best wishes for now.

3 CONT Hi Thomas'
3 CONT
3 CONT Thank you for your email.  I have completely lost Daniel!  He was my great
3 CONT grandfather, and was heard of no more after the birth of the youngest
3 CONT daughter in 1867.  When my grandmother was married in 1885, it was stated in
3 CONT the newspaper that she was daughter of the 'late Daniel Wetmore of Liverpool
3 CONT and Lima'.  I cannot find his death anywhere and have jumped to the
3 CONT conclusion that he pushed off, and probably took up with a Peruvian woman!!!
3 CONT Apart from being a mariner, publican and various other things, he was listed
3 CONT as railway architect!!  presumably this was because of his time in Peru.
3 CONT There is quite a bit on the net about Jesse, who seems to have made a
3 CONT success of his life.
3 CONT
3 CONT Are you a descendant of his son Douglas, or from another branch of the
3 CONT family.  There is a lot about Wetmores  in various places and I have quite
3 CONT an extensive family tree.  They seemed to have huge families, and each
3 CONT person seemed to marry several times!
3 CONT
3 CONT I do hope you have some information about Daniel.  He was married at least
3 CONT once before he married my little Welsh great granny, and indeed called the
3 CONT child of the first Liverpool marriage Phoebe Elizabeth (the same name as my
3 CONT grandmother!, but that child died as an infant (I bought that first marriage
3 CONT certificate and the child's birth certificate).  I, again, assume that the
3 CONT Liverpool wife Ann, died sometime before he married my great granny,
3 CONT Elizabeth Roberts.
3 CONT
3 CONT I am sure we can solve a problem or two if we put our heads together!!  Are
3 CONT you in USA?  I am in Australia.

3 CONT valedictorian of the Class of 1868 at the College of California in Oakland. In 1869,
3 CONT Clarence became the first student to register at the newly established University of California
3 CONT (chartered in 1868 to be the successor to the College of California). Clarence???s class attended
3 CONT classes for all four years at the old Oakland campus of the College of California, but on their
3 CONT graduation day in 1873, this group of pioneering students received their diplomas at the first
3 CONT event ever held on the Berkeley campus.

3 CONT Cresta Blanca Winery in the Livermore Valley in 1882. The Cresta Blanca Winery property is today

2 TEXT RAILROAD BUILDING IN PERU
2 TEXT Noting the recent reutrn of Mr. Jesse L. Wetmore of San Francisco, the "Alta" of that city says:
3 CONT "Mr. Wetmore came to California in '49, and was at one time well known in this city as a street
3 CONT contractor. During the last twelve years he has been connected with railroad operations in Chili
3 CONT and Peru, and was the first to work the extensive guano mines at Mexillones, Boliva.
3 CONT He built and established the first Protestant church in the City of Santiago, Chili, about
3 CONT eight years ago. In June, 1871, he undertook the work of constructing the eastern division
3 CONT of the Lima and Oroya railroad in Peru. The work of grading was commenced at the little
3 CONT Indian town of Oroya, which takes its name from the swinging bridge erected across a rapid
3 CONT torrent of the eastern water-shed of the Andes. Here the altitude is 12,200 feet above the
3 CONT level of the sea. The line going west toward the Pacific rapidly ascends the Andes to an
3 CONT an altitude of over 15,000 feet, where the summit tunnel is located. In all the country
3 CONT embracing the interior basin of the Andean chain, no firewood is obtained, and lumber for the
3 CONT most ordinary purposes is very costly. Poles are brough on the backs of mules from the eastern
3 CONT base of the cordilleras, a distnce of over twenty-five leagues, and boards are packed in
3 CONT short piees across the great snow ridge from the Pacific coast. For light packing, great
3 CONT numbers of llamas are found cerviceable ans superior to asses or mules, inasmuch as they
3 CONT can be subsisted on the coarse grasses that grow on the elevated pampas, while the other
3 CONT beasts of burden are sustained by alfalfa raised in the Tarma and other valleys, whence the
3 CONT cost of transportation is considerable. Notwithstanding the difficulties, the cold
3 CONT weather, the extreme rarity of the atmosphere, the scarcity of all articles necessary in
3 CONT the preparation of railroad work, and the indolent character of the native Inca Indian
3 CONT laborer, the work is now accomplished, and the roadbed is ready to reeive the ties and
3 CONT rails as soon as the western division is made to connect, so that the iron and wood may
3 CONT be brought up on the finished track.
2 TEXT Mr. Wetmore, wife, and daughter have been living recently as Visca, occupying an old church
3 CONT near the summit of the Andes, at an altitude higher than that of Mont Blanc.
3 CONT The ladies seem to have endured the extraordinary hardship imposed by the climate of
3 CONT such an elevated region with remarkable fortitude, and have come down from the snows
3 CONT and the clouds with buoyant spirits and good health. They were obliged to cross
3 CONT altitudes of over 16,500 feet, and have traveled on several occasions twelve and
3 CONT fiftenn leagues a day over great reidges and folds of these Titan mountains,
3 CONT and all the time being above the sea from 10,000 to 16,000 fee. Miss Wetmore as brought
3 CONT with her a collection of valuagle archaeological specimens, relics of the ancient
3 CONT life that once was diffused throughout the desolate mountain valleys and ridges.
3 CONT Among them are skulls of the Aymara Indians, pottery from old Inca graves, &c.
3 CONT Fine wool llama skins and specimens of minerals--silver, lime, &c., are also
3 CONT brought with her."

1 TEXT Timothy Wetmore
2 CONT Rye's first lawyer is said to have been Timothy Wetmore, who,
2 CONT it appears, was a man versatile and influential, and of many
2 CONT activities, his reputation extending throughout the county.
2 CONT While, perhaps, he may have been the first regularly licensed
2 CONT lawyer in the town, and doubtless was the first lawyer who
2 CONT lived in what is now the town of Rye, he, neverthe less, was
2 CONT preceded by several persons who became prominent in the law and
2 CONT identified with the county judiciary, such as John Thomas,
2 CONT Edward Thomas, William Willett, and Gilbert Willett, all of
2 CONT whom lived in that part of Rye township then known as
2 CONT Harrison's Purchase. Timothy Wetmore was a son of the Rev. James
2 CONT and Anna (Dwight) Wetmore. The Rev. James Wet- more was born
2 CONT at Middletown, Conn., December 31, 1695, and educated at
2 CONT Saybrook Academy and Yale University, receiving from the latter
2 CONT the degrees of A.B. and A. M. He was ordained in 1718, as first
2 CONT pastor of the Congregational Church of North Haven, Conn., and
2 CONT continued his labors there for about four years. Doubting the
2 CONT validity of his ordination, he resigned his charge, and, in 1723,
2 CONT went to England where he was ordained deacon and priest of the
2 CONT Church of England. He returned to America in 1726, and was
2 CONT inducted as rector of the parish of Rye, which then extended
2 CONT considerably beyond the present confines of the town. Here he
2 CONT remained until his death of the smallpox, May 15, 1760.
2 CONT His wife died February 28, 1771. Besides Timothy, their other
2 CONT children were James ; Alethea, wife of Rev. Joseph Lamson;
2 CONT Anna, wife of Gilbert Brundage; Charity, wife of Josiah Purdy;
2 CONT and Esther, who first married David Brown, and secondly Jesse
2 CONT Hunt, high sheriff of the county in 1780. It is said of the
2 CONT Rev. Mr. Wetmore that, such was his zeal for episcopacy, he once
2 CONT declared he would rather join in worship with a Jewish synagogue,
2 CONT than with a Presbyterian church. He must have been a man of no
2 CONT inconsiderable intellectual attainment, having published a
2 CONT letter against Dickinson in defense of Waterland's discourse
2 CONT on regeneration; a vindi cation of the professors of the Church
2 CONT of England in answer to Hobart's sermon in favor of Presbyterian
2 CONT ordination; a rejoinder to Hobart's serious address; an appendix
2 CONT to Beach's vindication, and other papers. Timothy Wetmore was
2 CONT born in Rye in or about the year 1736. He first studied for the
2 CONT ministry, but circumstances prevented his going to England for
2 CONT ordination. He was among the first graduates of Kings, now
2 CONT Columbia, College, in 1758. He subse quently studied law and was
2 CONT licensed to practice April 26, 1770. Mr. Wetmore first married
2 CONT October 21, 1756, Jane Haviland, of Rye. Of this marriage were
2 CONT born James, Jane, Anna, Timothy, Fletcher, Thomas, Luther,
2 CONT Theodore, and Robert Griffith. His second marriage was to Rachel,
2 CONT widow of Benjamin Ogden, of New York, of which marriage there
2 CONT was no issue. About 1753, he was appointed schoolmaster in
2 CONT Rye Parish by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
2 CONT Foreign Parts, and continued to teach until 1769. In 1763,
2 CONT soon after the death of his father, he owned and was living in
2 CONT the Square House, now the municipal hall of Rye village, and
2 CONT which his father had owned and lived in. It is possi ble that
2 CONT Timothy Wetmore was born in this historic structure. By this
2 CONT time he had become a figure of com manding influence in the
2 CONT town. After his father's death, the Rye Parish was for some
2 CONT time without a rector. This was bitterly complained of by
2 CONT some of the people, and, on May 6, 1761, Timothy Wet- more
2 CONT addressed a letter to the secretary of the society, voicing
2 CONT his complaint of the lack of a minister and stating that he
2 CONT had assumed to read the services and administer the sacraments.
2 CONT In July, 1762, the Rev. Ebenezer Punderson, of New Haven, was
2 CONT called and commenced his labors. In November, 1764, a number
2 CONT of the inhabitants united in a pe tition to the lieutenant
2 CONT governor of the province asking incorporation of the parish.
2 CONT This petition, which was granted in the following month, contained
2 CONT the signatures of Timothy Wetmore and John Thomas, who afterward
2 CONT became bitter enemies. Troublous times were now upon the
2 CONT inhabitants of the town, a great many of whom, particularly
2 CONT those of the Established Church, sided with the Crown. Timothy
2 CONT Wetmore became a pronounced tory and joined with others, on
2 CONT September 14, 1774, in a declaration of loyalty, expressing
2 CONT their "great desire and full resolution to live and die
2 CONT peaceable subjects to our gracious sovereign, King George
2 CONT the Third, and his laws." In November, 1774, however, Mr.
2 CONT Wetmore issued a statement in which he explained and qualified
2 CONT his endorsement of the declaration of loyalty, but he still
2 CONT protested his loyalty to the King. It is related that a certain
2 CONT George Harris, who was also a school teacher in the town, in
2 CONT addressing a petition to the convention of New York State,
2 CONT in 1776, referred to Timothy Wetmore as "that arch Tory or enemy
2 CONT to his country, who has and does yet keep up the spirit of
2 CONT Toryism in Rye. " At the close of the war in 1783, Mr. Wetmore
2 CONT removed to the Province of New Brunswick, and at the opening
2 CONT of the supreme court in St. John, 1788, was admitted to the Bar.
2 CONT He settled at Gagetown, where he held a number of county offices.
2 CONT His son, Thomas, was admitted as attorney in 1788, and a
2 CONT copartnership between father and son was afterward formed.
2 CONT The following is a copy of the copartner ship notice:
2 CONT LAW OFF1CE At the house lately occupied by Mr. Fitzsimon,
2 CONT King Street, St. John, where constant attendance will be given.
2 CONT Having also an office at Fredericton, the seat of the Government,
2 CONT they will have it in their power to transact business with the
2 CONT utmost dispatch the rules of government will admit.
2 CONT T1MOTHY WETMORE,
2 CONT THOMAS WETMORE.
2 CONT 16th July, 1793.
2 CONT In 1800, Timothy Wetmore returned to New York, where he took up
2 CONT his residence. He died there in March, 1820, in the eighty-fifth
2 CONT year of his age. It would be interesting to speculate upon what,
2 CONT if any, controversies took place between Timothy Wet- more, the
2 CONT Tory, and John Jay, the Patriot, who both at one time lived in
2 CONT the town of Rye, and who must have been thrown in frequent contact
2 CONT with each other.

3 CONT land (of which I have received none) shall be paid to Josiah,
3 CONT and what that falls short of paying the extraordinary charge he
3 CONT shall be at in paying doctors, nurses, etc., for my wife, shall
3 CONT be paid out of my moveable estate before any distribution
3 CONT thereof be made.  To my son Israhiah's heirs I give and bequeath
3 CONT what I gave their father by deed of gift, and also 1/6 part of
3 CONT my lott in the third division of land on the east side of the
3 CONT Great River;  this I give them and their heirs forever.  To my
3 CONT son James Wetmore I give and bequeath, besides what I have
3 CONT already given him, 1/6 part of my lott in the third division of
3 CONT land on the east side of the Great River.  To my son Seth
3 CONT Wetmore, besides what I have already given him, I give and
3 CONT bequeath 1/6 part of my lott in the third division on the east
3 CONT side of the Great River.  And also, on consideration of the
3 CONT lawsuit he maintained against Hope Hawley, I give him 1 equal
3 CONT half of my lott called the new lott; but in case he sells it, my
3 CONT will is that Josiah can have the refusal of it.  I give to my
3 CONT son Jeremiah, besides what I have already given him, my bond
3 CONT lott on the east side of the Great River; also 1/6 part of my
3 CONT lott in the third division of lands there.  I give to my son

3 CONT lott in the third division of land on the east side of the Great
3 CONT River; also 1/4 and 1/2 quarter of my interest in the sawmill
3 CONT and half the land adjoining.  I give to my son Josiah Wetmore
3 CONT the remainder of my homelott after Seth and Jeremiah hath
3 CONT measured off to them what I gave them by deed, together with all
3 CONT the buildings standing thereon;  and also the whole of my two
3 CONT meadow lots, viz., my lott just within the meadow gate and that
3 CONT near the Ferry River; and also the equal half of my lott called
3 CONT the new lott; and also my pasture at Indian Hill; and also 1/6
3 CONT part of my lott in the third division of land on the east side
3 CONT of the Great River; 1 and 1/2 quarter of my interest in the
3 CONT sawmill, also 1/2 of the land adjoining.  Also, I give him all
3 CONT my husbandry tools and carpentry tools and tackling of what name
3 CONT soever, obliging him to pay all my just debts, funeral charges,
3 CONT and legacies to my wife, except the extraordinary charge of my
3 CONT wife's illness, for which I have made some provisions in this
3 CONT will.  And I do hereby order him to pay to Sara, the wife of
3 CONT Daniel Prior, Jr., #5 money within one year after my decease.
3 CONT I give to my grandson Israhiah Wetmore 1/4 of my interest in the
3 CONT sawmill.  And further, my will is that what shall remain of my
3 CONT moveable estate (two notes under Josiah's hands: the one dated
3 CONT 15 April, 1736, for the sum of #60 money, the other dated 9 May,
3 CONT 1737, for the sum of #30 money, and my stock in Josiah's hands,
3 CONT viz: two oxen, two cows, one horse valued at #10, two swine and
3 CONT 15 sheep) shall be equally divided among my sons, accounting
3 CONT Israhiah's heirs in his stead.  And I appoint my son Josiah to

1 TEXT Thomas Wetmore was born in the town of Rye, September 20, 1767.
2 CONT He was the son of Timothy Wetmore, who has been credited with being
2 CONT Rye's first lawyer, and Jane Haviland Wetmore.
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas Wetmore removed with his father, at the close of the
2 CONT Revolutionary War, to the province of New Brunswick, and after
2 CONT studying law in the office of Ward Chipman, one of the most
2 CONT prominent lawyers of the province, was admitted as an attorney
2 CONT in the year 1788.
2 CONT In 1793, he and his father formed a copartnership, and engaged
2 CONT in the practice of law at St. John, maintaining an office at
2 CONT Fredericton, which was then the seat of the government.
2 CONT Mr. Wetmore was recorder for the city of St. John in 1809-1810,
2 CONT and attorney-general of the province 1809-28.
2 CONT
2 CONT We are indebted to the Hon. J. B. M. Baxter, until lately
2 CONT attorney-general for the province of New Brunswick, for much
2 CONT information concerning both Timothy Wetmore and Thomas Wetmore.
2 CONT In "Judges of New Brunswick and Their Times," a copy of which
2 CONT has been presented to us by the Hon. Mr. Baxter, there
2 CONT appears the following:
2 CONT
2 CONT "Thomas Wetmore, in 1793, married, at Gagetown, a daughter of
2 CONT James Peters, and on the death of Colin Campbell, in 1796, was
2 CONT appointed Clerk of the Crown of the Supreme Court.
2 CONT The year 1809 was a red-letter one to Thomas Wetmore, as on the
2 CONT appointment in that year of Ward Chipman to the Bench,
2 CONT he succeeded to the recordership of St. John, and on the
2 CONT appointment of Jonathan Bliss as Chief Justice, he succeeded
2 CONT to the office of Attorney-General, and was elected as one of
2 CONT the members of the Legislature for the City of St. John.
2 CONT Shortly afterwards, Mr. Wetmore removed with his family to
2 CONT York County. His daughter Margaret married Thomas Carleton Lee,
2 CONT and another daughter, Ann Peters, married Dr. John Head;
2 CONT the latter died at an early age, leaving a daughter, who
2 CONT subsequently became the wife of the Rev. Canon Ketchum, Rector of
2 CONT St. Andrews; Sarah married George Pidgeon Bliss; Susan,
2 CONT George J. Dibblee; and Emma, John Bedell.
2 CONT
2 CONT "There were four sons, George Ludlow Wetmore, father of the
2 CONT Honorable A. Rainsford Wetmore, a puisne Judge of the Supreme
2 CONT Court of New Brunswick, and Charles P. Wetmore, for nearly fifty
2 CONT years Clerk of the House of Assembly, who died at Fredericton
2 CONT in 1883, in his 86th year,  the latter's son, E. L. Wetmore, is a
2 CONT judge in the Province of Saskatchewan, Canada.
2 CONT Timothy R. Wetmore, the third son, held an important office in
2 CONT Queens County; he died at Gagetown in 1883, aged 82 years;
2 CONT a daughter married the Honorable D. L. Hanington, a Judge of the
2 CONT Supreme Court of New Brunswick; Thomas, the youngest son, followed
2 CONT the medical profession, and in 1840 married a daughter of the
2 CONT Honorable F. Robinson, Auditor-General, who died at Fredericton.
2 CONT Attorney-General Thomas Wetmore has been described as a man eminently
2 CONT distinguished for his talents, benevolence, and hospitality.
2 CONT His hand was always open to the poor, and he was a friend to all.
2 CONT As a lawyer and advocate, he stood high in his profession.
2 CONT He died at his residence, Kingswood, York County, March 22, 1828,
2 CONT aged 62 years."
2 CONT
2 CONT Thomas Wetmore seems also to have been promi nent in Masonic circles,
2 CONT reference being made to him in Bunting's History of Freemasonry in
2 CONT New Bruns wick, showing that on September 28, 1816, acting as Grand Master,
2 CONT he laid the corner stone of the Ma sonic hall in St. John.

2 CONT be identified.
2 CONT "Jer Sabens," signing by mark, conveyed to Mary's brother

1 TEXT This Jeremiah Sabin, or his son, may have been the "Jeremiah
2 CONT Sabean" who signed a Casco Bay ME petition in Nov. 1760; and
2 CONT that man was the "Jereh Sabins," grantee of Penobscot Township,
2 CONT 27 Jan. 1764.
2 CONT The son Jeremiah was surely the man who, with his family,
2 CONT "first settled at Argyle, Nova Scotia in 1762, then moved to
2 CONT the mouth of the Sissiboo River there."
2 CONT No death or probate record for Jeremiah Sabin appears in York

1 TEXT Francis Billington lived at Plymouth until 1669, when he moved
2 CONT to Middleboro and occupied land granted to him as one of the
2 CONT "First Comers."
2 CONT He lived there until his death, except for a few years during
2 CONT King Philip's War when he fled to Plymouth for safety.
2 CONT On 18 April 1642 his daughter Elizabeth was apprenticed; and 14
2 CONT January 1642/3 he bound out son Joseph, aged "vi or vii" and
2 CONT two daughters, probably Martha and Mary, one five years old and
2 CONT the other even younger.
2 CONT Bradford stated in 1651 that Francis Billington had eight
2 CONT children.
1 TEXT In his old age Francis was dependent on his son Isaac for
2 CONT support and died intestate.
2 CONT No probate record appears, although son Isaac petitioned the
2 CONT probate court in 1703/4 for title to all his father's
2 CONT Middleboro lands, stating he had had sole care of his parents
2 CONT in their old age.
2 CONT A Plymouth County Court case of Sept. 1722, brought by Isaac's
2 CONT daughter Desire4 [Billington] Bonney and her husband, James,
2 CONT shows that Francis Billington died intestate leaving issue two
2 CONT sons and five daughters, viz: sons Joseph (eldest, who
2 CONT inherited a double portion) and Isaac; daughters Elizabeth,
2 CONT Mary, Dorcas, Mercy and Martha, with a total of eight shares in
2 CONT the estate.
2 CONT A 1719 quitclaim deed from Francis's grandson Francis
2 CONT Billington, reading "my father Francis and grandfather
2 CONT [unnamed] Billington" seems to imply a son Francic, Jr.
2 CONT But in the absence of any mention of such a son in
2 CONT contemporaneous Plymouth records, coupled with the fact that
2 CONT Francis4's deed evidently transferred the shares of Joseph
2 CONT Billington, we conclude that the deed contains a clerical
2 CONT error.
2 CONT The original must have read "my father Joseph and grandfather
2 CONT Francis Billington."
2 CONT Indications are that the seven children named in the Bonney
2 CONT suit and their progeny were the only survivors of Francis
2 CONT Billington.

1 TEXT Dear Helen,
2 CONT I believe I received this letter by mistake so am returning
2 CONT it.  It was good to hear from you and to know about the
2 CONT family.  My news is not so good Clare left me before
2 CONT Christmas for another woman.  I am working in a delicatessen
2 CONT 6 days a week but only 5 hrs a day it is enough to get me bye
2 CONT as long as Clare pays the bills but he hasn't been too good
2 CONT at that either.  It is a long story but to cut it short he is
2 CONT just a completely changed man from what he was some say age.
2 CONT He doesn't give me an answer.  Bev graduated in 1971 and has
2 CONT worked in the lab at the hospital for 2 1/2 yrs.  She is 22
2 CONT and not married.  Larry graduated in 1974 and is not
2 CONT married.  He is looking for work right now.  He got mixed up
2 CONT with a group of boys and has given me a few problems, but I
2 CONT guess things will get better for him soon.  Don't know
2 CONT any-thing about Elwood.  Clare & I saw Dan & Jayne last year
2 CONT in Cincinnati at a bowling tournament.  Will write more
2 CONT later.  Everything has been quite mixed up for me since
2 CONT Christmas.
2 CONT Love, Alice

2 CONT duties she would need to run her own household if she
2 CONT married, or to support herself as a servant.
2 CONT
2 CONT Mindwell Wetmore, the daughter of Thomas Wetmore, "one of the
2 CONT poor" of Middletown, was one of many such girls to be so
2 CONT apprenticed.
2 CONT She was sent for a year, in 1769, to Benjamin Wetmore of
2 CONT Waterbury to be "taught to read English well, and to do
2 CONT household work knitting spinning sewing and the like.

1 OBIT
2 TEXT DEATH OF MR. A. R. WETMORE
2 TEXT
2 TEXT HIS CONNECTION WITH MANY CHARITABLE WORKS
2 TEXT
2 TEXT Apollos Russell Wetmore, whose name has been prominently associated with the best philanthropic
2 TEXT efforts in the City for the last 25 or 30 years, died quietly in his bed at an early hour yesterday
2 TEXT morning, at the residence of his son-in-law, Mr. Charles E. Carryl, No. 33 West Ninth-street.
2 TEXT Mr. Wetmore retired to his room in his usual health on Thursday night, having passed the afternoon
2 TEXT in examining the affairs of the New York Juvenile Asylum, in which, as one of the founders, he was
2 TEXT particulary interested.
2 TEXT He left the office of the asylum about 5 o'clock, and went home.
2 TEXT Yesterday morning he did not make his appearance at the breakfast table as usual, and, after
2 TEXT waiting a few minutes, one of the members of the household went to his room.
2 TEXT He was found lying upon his bed in apparent repose, and had evidently expired in sleep without a struggle.
2 TEXT The extremities were still warm, showing that life had been extict only a few minutes--or an hour at furthest.
2 TEXT The event was not altogether unexpected, for, in addition to his advance age, Mr. Wetmore lived in
2 TEXT constant danger of apoplexy, and had been warned by his medical advisor that his demise would be sudden.
2 TEXT He had often observed that he had no dearer wish than "to die with the harness on."
2 TEXT For the last few years, since he retired from business in 1876, Mr. Wetmore had taken a particular interest
2 TEXT in various philanthropic movements, particularly in the Juvenile Asylum, the City Mission, the Association
2 TEXT for the Relief of the Poor, the Home for the Ruptured and Crippled, the Presbyterian Hospital, the Home
2 TEXT for Girls, ad the Woman's Hospital, one of the valuable featurs of which is the new Wetmore Pavilion.
2 TEXT In all of these institutions, as well as in the Tract Society, his assistance and advice were invaluable
2 TEXT
2 TEXT Mr. Wetmore was born in Danbury, Conn., Nov. 11, 1795, and inherited from his father, the Rev. Noah Wetmore,
2 TEXT a prominent minister, his bias for philanthropic enterprises.
2 TEXT When he was 13 years of age (in 1808) his father removed to this City, and became Superintendent of the New
2 TEXT York Hospital, which was then situated on Broadway.
2 TEXT In 1812 the son entered Columbia College, then at the foot of Marray-steet, but he did not graduate.
2 TEXT His health broke down under protracted study at the expiration of two years of college life, and in 1815
2 TEXT he entered the hardware store of Kip & Ingraham, where he remained for three years.
2 TEXT In 1818 he embarked in business for himself, in partnership with his brother, D. N. Wetmore, with whom he
2 TEXT remained until 1824, when he formed a copartnership with J. C. Green, who had served with him as a clerk.
2 TEXT The firm style was given as Green & Wetmore, and their establishment, at the corner of Washington and Vesey
2 TEXT streets, was for many years a landmark of the hardware trade in the City
2 TEXT The firm lasted for 11 years, at the expiration of which Mr. Green retired, and the business was continued
2 TEXT as Wetmore & Co.
2 TEXT
2 TEXT In 1830 Mr. Wetmore joined the Presbyterian church in Laight-street, under the pastorate of the
2 TEXT celebrated Dr. Cox.
2 TEXT From this date he had been active in all noble projects for the elevation of the dependent classes and the
2 TEXT rescue of the suffering.
2 TEXT in 1831, in conjunction with other prominent gentlemen, he founded the New York Tract Society, which was
2 TEXT incorporated at a later date with the City Mission, another of his philantrhopic creations.
2 TEXT The Presidency of this society was an office which he held for many years, and with which he was invested
2 TEXT at the time of his death.
2 TEXT He next gave his attention to the rescue of children from criminal and destructive influences, and thus laid
2 TEXT a firm basis for the work of the New York Juvenile Asylum, another of his philanthropic creations, of whose
2 TEXT Board of Managers he served as President for many years.
2 TEXT He was one of the active spirits in the foundation of the Society ofr Improving the Condition of the Poor,
2 TEXT and helped to bring into existence the Washing and Bathing Society, which however, perished after a few
2 TEXT years of precarious struggle.
2 TEXT
2 TEXT In 1822, at the age of 27, Mr. Wetmore was married to Mary Carmer, of this City, and eight years ago
2 TEXT celebrated his golden wedding with great ceremony.
2 TEXT Four years later, in 1876, Mrs. Wetmore died, and her bereaved husband took up his residence with one of
2 TEXT his married daughters, Mrs. Carryl.
2 TEXT Of the six children born of this marriage, the eldest, Henry C. Wetmore, is dead; the remaining five --
2 TEXT George C. Wetmore, Theodore R. Wetmore, William Wetmore, and the two daughters, Mrs. Henry Mesier and
2 TEXT Mrs. Charles E. Carryl--are well known in the highest social circles.
2 TEXT
2 TEXT As a philanthropist, Mr. Wetmore was regarded as a practical man in the management of institutions rather
2 TEXT than a theorist.
2 TEXT He believed in doing, not in talking, and devoted his time to results rather than theoretical explanations.
2 TEXT His name ranks with that of Howard and Peabody in this department of modern activity, and his association
2 TEXT with a project was considered a guarantee of both of the good faith of its promoters and of ultimate success.
2 TEXT Thousands of children during the last 20 years have owed their rescue from infamy and vice to his efforts,
2 TEXT and thousands of the City's poor have blessed his name as that of a benefactor.
2 TEXT His uprightness was a proverb, his kindness to the suffering a sunny spot in human experience.
2 TEXT The arrangements for the funeral have not been fully perfected.
2 TEXT The services will take place at 11  o'clock A.M. on Monday, at the Madison-Square Presbyterian Church,
2 TEXT the Rev. Mr. Parkhurst officiating and the Rev. Dr. Hall assisting.
2 TEXT Seats will be reserved for the delegates of the various boards with which he was associated, but other
2 TEXT details, such as the names of the pall-bearers, &c., remain to be announced hereafter.

1 BIO
2 TEXT Charles Hinckley Wetmore was born at Lebanon, Connecticut, on
3 NOTE February 8, 1820.
3 NOTE By teaching school in the winter and studying in the summer, he
3 NOTE attained his medical degree, graduating from the Berkshire Medical
3 NOTE Institute in Massachusetts in 1846.
3 NOTE After graduation Dr. Wetmore practiced in Lowell, Massachusetts,
3 NOTE while continuing to teach to supplement his income.
3 NOTE Taking service as a missionary doctor under the American Mission
3 NOTE Board, Dr. Wetmore married Lucy Sheldon Taylor on September 25,
3 NOTE 1848, at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, just three weeks prior to
3 NOTE sailing for Hawaii.
3 NOTE The doctor was not attached to any Missionary Company; and he and
3 NOTE his bride took passage on the "Leland", arriving in Honolulu
3 NOTE March 11, 1849, after a voyage of 146 days.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE The Wetmores were assigned to Hilo, Hawaii, and were at their new
3 NOTE post by May 18.
3 NOTE Dr. Wetmore considered that his first professional duty was to care
3 NOTE for the missionary families, then the natives, and after that the
3 NOTE foreigners.
3 NOTE His patients were scattered over the entire island, and he
3 NOTE traveled by canoe, when this was possible, but mostly by foot.
3 NOTE On many occasions Mrs. Wetmore accompanied him.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE In 1850 the Wetmore's first child, a son, was stillborn.
3 NOTE It was out of their grief for the loss of this child that they
3 NOTE were led to establish a school for half-caste children that same
3 NOTE year.
3 NOTE The children, who numbered 13 that first year, were, with one
3 NOTE exception, Chinese-Hawaiian.
3 NOTE Three years later a second son, Charles Hinckley, Jr., was born
3 NOTE (who died in his 14th. year), in 1855 Frances Matilda was born,
3 NOTE then Catherine (Mrs. Henry Deacon) in 1859, and in 1860 Lucy
3 NOTE Taylor (Mrs. Charles Lewis).
3 NOTE
3 NOTE The smallpox epidemic of 1853 resulted in 75 deaths in the Hilo

2 TEXT Frances Matilda Wetmore was born June 29, 1855, at Hilo, Hawaii.
3 NOTE She was the daughter of the missionary doctor, Charles Hinckley
3 NOTE Wetmore, and his wife, Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE On July 26, 1867, Frances' beloved brother, Charlie, died suddenly
3 NOTE at the age of fourteen.
3 NOTE This tragedy served to strengthen her desire to become a doctor.
3 NOTE At fifteen she had exhausted all that local sources could offer in
3 NOTE the way of education, and in April, 1870, she was sent to
3 NOTE relatives in New England to continue her studies.
3 NOTE There she attended Mount Holyoke College at South Hadley,
3 NOTE Massachusetts.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE After graduation, Frances returned to Hilo where the greater part
3 NOTE of her time was spent in her father's drug store.
3 NOTE In Dr. Wetmore's absence, she waited on customers and helped
3 NOTE patients.
3 NOTE So successful was she in caring for their needs that Dr. Wetmore
3 NOTE wrote to his sister that people were sending for her to doctor
3 NOTE them and added, "she will use her needle better in surgery, I
3 NOTE think, than for anything else."
3 NOTE
3 NOTE In 1879 Frances left Hilo to enter Woman's Medical college in
3 NOTE Philadelphia.
3 NOTE Apparently, she received her M.D. by the end of 1882, since by
3 NOTE January, 1883, she had returned to Hilo and was her father's
3 NOTE partner.
3 NOTE Affectionately known as Dr. Fanny, she was beloved by the
3 NOTE Hawaiians and had a circle of friends including nearly everyone on
3 NOTE Hawaii.
3 NOTE In 1888 she was appointed government physician for Hilo by the
3 NOTE Board of Health, in all probability, the first woman to ever hold
3 NOTE such a position in the Islands. Her salary was $600 a year.
3 NOTE In 1989 she was made consulting physician at Hilo Hospital.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE In the course of a long and active life, Dr. Fanny was a member of
3 NOTE the Cousins' Society (from 1856), Woman's Board of Missions of the
3 NOTE First Foreign Church, trustee of the property of the Aloha Circle
3 NOTE of King's Daughters and Sons (charter member in 1889), secretary
3 NOTE of the Free Kindergarten Committee, trustee of the Hilo Boarding
3 NOTE School (from 1898), and trustee of the Hilo Public Library.
3 NOTE
3 NOTE On March 12, 1919, Dr. Wetmore died at Hilo with a few months of
3 NOTE her 64th. birthday.

3 CONT
3 CONT Serving in the Navy, at Sebastopal, he was commended for
3 CONT special gallantry during the bombardment.
3 CONT
3 CONT After the War, Queen Victoria gave a dinner for special heroes,
3 CONT at Windsor Castle.  She was astonished when this 14-year-old lad
3 CONT was presented and spent some time questioning him all about
3 CONT himself.  Remarking that she regretted that there was no award
3 CONT for such special gallantry, she dismissed him.  Very soon after,
3 CONT she instituted the Victoria Cross.
3 CONT
3 CONT Wetmore did not get the Cross, but he did get a special
3 CONT pension - the same as Cross-holders get - for life, in addition
3 CONT to another Pension.
3 CONT
3 CONT He died at him home in West Bay, N.B., in 1907, and is buried

2 TEXT ... John Norton Wetmore was born 30 May 1876, presumably in
3 CONT England, probably near Bristol.
3 CONT He was my Grandfather, and married my Grandmother Edith Frances
3 CONT Ellen Williams on 10 November 1910, but I don't know where.
3 CONT I had heard that he came out to Rhodesia before this century, and
3 CONT was somehow involved with the British Forces in Southern Africa
3 CONT at the time of the Boer Wars, 1899 to 1902.
3 CONT As you know, the history of England in South Africa somewhat
3 CONT mirrored that of the North American continent 200 years previously.
3 CONT It would be ironical if the Norton Wetmores had come from loyalist
3 CONT Canada to Rhodesia, even if via England.
3 CONT
3 CONT These two produced four male children, Robert Norton W (my
3 CONT father - deceased Oct 22 1989), Grenvill George Norton W (deceased
3 CONT 14 Dec 1967), Cecil Norton living in retirement in Harare
3 CONT Zimbabwe, and incidentally very interested in the family ancestry,
3 CONT and David George Norton W (deceased21 December 1987).
3 CONT There are many next generation including myself, and our children.
3 CONT All of us left Rhodesia in the last ten to fifteen years, going
3 CONT all over the commonwealth.
3 CONT I am married to a German lady, for 22 years now, and we have three
3 CONT boys, all Nortons!
3 CONT
3 CONT My father was a diplomat, and represented Rhodesia in the USA from
3 CONT 1957 to 1962.
3 CONT My brother Michael and I were also there of course, in Washington
3 CONT DC, and the period happened to coincide with my senior school years.
3 CONT Due to the fact that in 1957 when my father was making plans to go
3 CONT to the States he happened to sit next to a Canadian insurance
3 CONT executive on a plane, I ended up at school in Canada.
3 CONT This was Ridley College in St Catharines near Niagara Falls.
3 CONT You can understand why he chose Canada, because at that time the
3 CONT Russians had just put up the first Sputnik and the Americans were
3 CONT suffering agonies of remorse and doubt over their schooling system,
3 CONT and my father was taking no chances.
3 CONT My stay in Canada was therefore punctuated with 8 times a year
3 CONT trips from St Catharines to DC.
3 CONT These commenced with steam drawn trains and ended in 1962 in
3 CONT Greyhound buses when even the electric trains were being withdrawn.
3 CONT I have not returned to those places in the intervening 34 years,
3 CONT and think that should I one day be lucky enough to revisit I
3 CONT should feel like Rip van Winkle did after his long sleep.
3 CONT My memories are vivid.
3 CONT
3 CONT My brother being 3 years older than me and knowing well the likely
3 CONT outcome of world history stayed on in 1962 and married an American
3 CONT girl on his 21st birthday.
3 CONT He is still there, living in Philadelphia I think and married for
3 CONT a second time.
3 CONT We have lost touch.
3 CONT
3 CONT In 62 on returning to Africa via England my father took me to
3 CONT visit Norton farm near Penzance in south east England.
3 CONT Near here we also spent some time with cousins who had been
3 CONT farming in the same place (in Cornwall) for some record number of
3 CONT generations.
3 CONT They were featured in National Geographic magazine a year or two
3 CONT after 1962 for that reason.
3 CONT That would probably be a fruitful source of family genealogy.
3 CONT I also have memory of a house called Henbury, I think near
3 CONT Bristol, which featured largely in the family history.
3 CONT This may have been where the Williams came from...

2 TEXT Clarence Wetmore (1851-1936) First to register at Univerity of California, Berkeley
2 TEXT Clarence Wetmore???s father, Jesse Lamereaux Wetmore, was one of those adventurous 49ers who
3 CONT came to California on the trail of gold. He returned home to Maine to father the second of
3 CONT his sons, Clarence, born in 1852, and then Jesse brought his wife and his two sons, Charles
3 CONT and Clarence back to the Golden State. The family settled first in San Francisco, but by 1861
3 CONT had settled in Oakland at their new home at Clay and Tenth.
2 TEXT But Jesse had wandering feet. He left again, this time for South America, engaged in railroad
3 CONT building in Chile and later, Bolivia. The family survived, and Charles became the
3 CONT valedictorian of the Class of 1868 at the College of California in Oakland. In 1869,
3 CONT Clarence became the first student to register at the newly established University of California
3 CONT (chartered in 1868 to be the successor to the College of California). Clarence???s class attended
3 CONT classes for all four years at the old Oakland campus of the College of California, but on their
3 CONT graduation day in 1873, this group of pioneering students received their diplomas at the first
3 CONT event ever held on the Berkeley campus.
2 TEXT Clarence married Mary Camden, a California native, and with his brother Charles, founded
3 CONT Cresta Blanca Winery in the Livermore Valley in 1882. The Cresta Blanca Winery property is today
3 CONT the home of Wente Brothers Sparkling Winery and the Wente Brothers Restaurant.

2 TEXT Cresta Blanca Wine Company, Livermore
2 TEXT A great name in the California wine industry, Cresta Blanca is owned by Schenley Industries.
3 CONT Since 1941 this company has operated the winery and tended the vineyards, which nestle in
3 CONT the gently sloping hills in the southeast corner of the Livermore Valley. Lucas Hat, whose
3 CONT family has been interested in growing grapes and making wine for generations, is in over-all
3 CONT charge of the vineyards and winery. The wine maker is Myron Nightingale, who has been closely
3 CONT associated with some of the industry's important experiments and achievements. A bonded winery
3 CONT is also maintained in Tulare County, right across the county line from Delano, Kern County.
3 CONT All Cresta Blanca wines are marketed through the CVA Corporation of San Francisco.
2 TEXT Founder of Cresta Blanca was the celebrated California wine pioneer Charles A. Wetmore,
3 CONT who purchased part of the old Rancho El Valle de San Jose in Livermore in 1882, planted his
3 CONT vineyards with selected imported cuttings, and built the Cresta Blanca winery in 1883.
3 CONT He named his winery and his wines after the limestone ridge which still dominates the
3 CONT vineyards and where a landslide at one time exposed a great white crest, sliced off the
3 CONT mountainside as by a giant's carving knife.
2 TEXT Charles Wetmore was born in Portland, Maine, in 1847 and came to California with his parents when
3 CONT he was nine years old. After attending public schools in Oakland he entered the newly
3 CONT established University of California, graduating with its very first class, of which he
3 CONT was valedictorian. He worked as a reporter on various newspapers, including the Alta California
3 CONT and the San Francisco Chronicle. Deeply interested in viticulture, he was appointed in 1878 as
3 CONT a delegate of the California State Vinicultural Society to visit the Paris Exposition.
3 CONT During this trip he made a thorough study of French winegrowing methods. On his return
3 CONT he organized the Board of State Viticultural Commissioners and served on it with prominence
3 CONT for a number of years. As an official of the California wine industry, as a winegrower, and as
3 CONT the author of treatises and articles on viticulture and wine production, Charles Wetmore was
3 CONT an outstanding authority on California wines for over half a century.
2 TEXT Wetmore considered that the gravelly soil at the mouth of the Canyon of the Arroyo del Valle
3 CONT in Livermore Valley offered every condition essential for producing the finest wines of the
3 CONT Bordeaux types. In Cresta Blanca he planted vines brought over from France, among them cuttings
3 CONT from Chateau d'Yquem in Sauternes and from Chateau Margaux in Medoc. He was a perfectionist in
3 CONT his methods, and the reputation of his Cresta Blanca wines became solidly established within a
3 CONT short time and their fame spread far and wide. The "Grand Prix" awarded to Cresta Blanca at the
3 CONT Paris Exposition of 1889 is said to mark the first time that California was officially recognized
3 CONT by France as a competitor in the production of fine table wines.
2 TEXT Clarence J. Wetmore, also a University of California graduate, became associated with his brother
3 CONT Charles in Cresta Blanca at an early date. In 1893 Clarence purchased the property from his brother
3 CONT and retained his connection with Cresta Blanca for over forty years, operating it until 1920,
3 CONT when he sold Cresta Blanca to L. B. Johnson. During Prohibition business was carried on, as allowed
3 CONT by the dry laws, for sacramental and medicinal purposes. With Repeal the corporation was reorganized
3 CONT with Clarence Wetmore once more as president and Johnson as general manager. With the death of
3 CONT Clarence Wetmore in 1936 Johnson became the sole owner. In 1941 the latter disposed of
3 CONT Cresta Blanca to Schenley.
2 TEXT Cresta Blanca produces table, aperitif, dessert, and sparkling wines of high quality, some of
3 CONT which are outstanding. The winery has continued to feature its white table wines grown in the Livermore
3 CONT Valley and also emphasizes its red table wines from grapes grown in the Napa and Sonoma valleys.
3 CONT Cresta Blanca has been a leader in the field of high-quality California sherries and also developed
3 CONT a flor sherry which will be marketed in the near future. High-quality ports and vermouths have
3 CONT been produced; some special port wines have not as yet been put on the market.
2 TEXT All wines are marketed under the Cresta Blanca brand, some with the added Souvenir labeling.
2 TEXT Table wines: WHITE: Dry Semillon, Sweet Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Chateau Sauterne, Haut Sauterne
3 CONT and Sauterne, Grey Riesling and Riesling, Chablis;
2 TEXT RED: Cabernet, Pinot Noir and Red Pinot, Burgundy and Claret;
2 TEXT ROSE: Vin Rose.
2 TEXT Sparkling wines (bottle-fermented) : Champagne (medium dry, available also in magnums), Brut
3 CONT Champagne (quite dry), Pink Champagne (medium dry), and Sparkling Burgundy;
2 TEXT Aperitif and Dessert wines: Dry Watch Cocktail Sherry (pale, dry) and Triple Cream Sherry
3 CONT (golden, sweet), aged in small cooperage and outstanding sherries both, Palomino Sherry
3 CONT (pale, dry) and Souvenir Sherry (medium dry); Tawny Port and Ruby Port; Golden Muscatel;
3 CONT White Vermouth (Triple Dry) and Sweet Vermouth.

3 CONT Wetmore, dau. of Andrew and Lucy Wetmore and Gilbert Allen
3 CONT Wetmore, son of John Wetmore, Jr. and Jane Osborn Wetmore.
3 CONT TGW was born in Vermont in 1801 and GAW was born in New York
3 CONT in 1837. Gilbert is in Stadel's book, Andrew, Lucy, and Thankful
3 CONT Grace are not.
3 CONT GAW was my great-grandfather, and he moved to Nebraska Territory
3 CONT sometime prior to 1863.
3 CONT Living near him was Sylvenus Duryea, whose mother was TGW.
3 CONT I'm more of an amateur historian than a geneaologist, and I'm
3 CONT trying to learn what took Gilbert to Nebraska.
3 CONT If you would like some information on the Nebraska Wetmores,
3 CONT I will be happy to share what I have.

2 CONT It would not have been unusually for her to have a baby at 15 if she was poor and
2 CONT screwing around (that how my father got here to a 16 year old mother).  In 2010 you can still
2 CONT get married in North Carolina at 14 pregnant or 16 without parents permission.
2 CONT So far as I know they are Mary's children according to the family.  They would be Doug's step sons.
2 CONT
2 CONT Douglas had no middle name or initial and neither did his father Daniel.
2 CONT Douglas's son was not a Junior as his name is Douglas Daniel Wetmore.
2 CONT The family is up to Douglas Daniel Wetmore the fourth but actually it should be the third
2 CONT because the original Douglas had no middle name.
2 CONT This will help you if you find something else on them.

2 CONT Charles Camden (1817-1912) ??? Built First Paper Mill On West Coast
2 CONT
2 CONT Charles Camden was born in Aston Magna, England on January 29. 1817 and sailed to New York
2 CONT from Liverpool at the age of seventeen. He spent ten years in New York before sailing from Baltimore to
2 CONT Valpariso, Chile.
2 CONT
2 CONT Camden worked as an engineer in Chile and Peru, building the first paper mill on the Pacific Coast in Peru.
2 CONT While in Peru, he met and became friends and business partners with James Lick. In 1849,
2 CONT he heard about the discovery of gold up the coast in California and sailed for San Francisco.
2 CONT He worked at various occupations in Oakland and San Francisco before he and some friends decided
2 CONT that they would sail up the coast to find the Trinity River. Mistakingly believing that they had found it,
2 CONT they instead became the first boat to sail up the Eel River.
2 CONT
2 CONT He spent most of the next few years mining in Shasta County. In 1861, he built the Camden turnpike from
2 CONT Shasta to Tower House, a distance of twelve miles. Previous to that time the traffic of the
2 CONT country was carried on with pack mules, there being no wagon roads further than Shasta.
2 CONT He also fell in love during this time and married the former Philena Towner. One of his two daughters,
2 CONT Mary, married Clarence Wetmore.
2 CONT
2 CONT At the time of his death he owned property in Oakland, sawmills and mines in Shasta County
2 CONT and irrigation rights in Kern and San Diego counties.

1 NOTE 2421181. LEIGH (LEE) CARLETON WETMORE (son) b. Saint John West, Saint John Co., NB 22JUL1900.
2 CONT When Leigh Carleton Wetmore enlisted in the CEF 1AUG1916, he gave his residence
2 CONT as Lowell St, West Saint John, and his place-of-birth as Saint John and date as 22JUL1900.
2 CONT His next-of-kin he gave as his mother, Mrs. E. J. C. Wetmore.
2 CONT Apparently accepted, there is a notation that he is not allowed to proceed overseas
2 CONT until 22JUL1919. He described himself as a student, so probably was seeking adventure
2 CONT and release from the tedium of schoolwork (as well as being very patriotic.)
2 CONT He is described as 5 feet 4?? inches, with green eyes, fair complexion and light-brown hair;
2 CONT and as Church of England. He is indicated as a grenadier, suggesting he was mustered
2 CONT into a battery. He probably was accepted as his father was a major.
